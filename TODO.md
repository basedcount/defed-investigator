- add software icon as background to cards
- convert pill and software images to webp
- add filtering checkboxes in query page
- await defederation promise on client
- increase instanceList threshold, figure out way to make requests in batches
- bug: when software is unknown no defed info can be gathered
  - the list has many holes, so it happens fairly often (eg: lemm.ee, lemmy.basedcount.com)
  - maybe when the current API gets promoted to production there will be fewer holes
