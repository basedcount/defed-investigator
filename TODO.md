- smoothly increase values instead of loading one batch at a time
    - try chaining .then, increase total
    - try rewriting array every time (reactivity and whatnot) but consider race conditions
- convert pill and software images to webp
- add filtering checkboxes in query page
- bug: when software is unknown no defed info can be gathered
  - the list has many holes, so it happens fairly often (eg: lemm.ee, lemmy.basedcount.com)
  - maybe when the current API gets promoted to production there will be fewer holes
